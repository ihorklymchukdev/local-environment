"""Distinct-port forwarding on both providers.

`forward()` used to raise NotImplementedError whenever the ports differed. The
edge port is equal on both sides by design, so that covered every case the PoC
had -- but reaching a database inside the VM from a host tool needs a host port
that is free on the host, which is rarely the guest's.

Assertions are about constructed argv. Nothing here runs netsh or ssh.
