# Finishing the macOS Install — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make `OmeletSetup-<version>.pkg` install Lima itself, land the user on a status screen that hands them the SSH credentials a coding agent needs, and replace the Windows-looking setup window with a drawn one.

**Architecture:** Two new install-surface members carry every platform difference — `provider.runtime()` inserts an `install_runtime` step that downloads and verifies a pinned Lima release, and `provider.access()` returns the connection facts the status screen renders without knowing what SSH is. `host/setup_app/` becomes a package of two screens (wizard, status) over a shared theme and widget layer, routed by a readiness probe.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12+, stdlib only on the host (`typer` is the sole runtime dependency), tkinter/ttk for the window, PyInstaller one-dir + `pkgbuild`/`productbuild` for the package.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-macos-install-completion-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- **`host/` never imports `agent/`.** `tests/host/test_no_agent_import.py` enforces it by AST.
- **No platform branching outside `host/providers/`.** `tests/test_no_platform_leak.py` greps `host/**/*.py` and `agent/**/*.py` for `sys.platform`, `platform.system()`, `os.name`. `platform.machine()` is not grepped but belongs in `providers/` all the same.
- **The host's only runtime dependency is `typer`.** `tests/host/test_host_dependencies.py` fails on a declared or imported second one. No `requests`, no `yaml`.
- **Nothing from `agent/` or `engine/` may be added to a PyInstaller `datas` list.** `tests/host/test_frozen_bundle.py` checks every spec under `packaging/`. Lima is fetched at setup time and must never appear there.
- **`provider.exec()` returns a `Completed` and never raises.** Every caller checks `.ok` itself. A dropped result is a silent success — that bug has shipped in this repo twice.
- **Names declared in both `host/core/constants.py` and `agent/core/constants.py` must hold the same value** (`tests/test_constants_agree.py`, intersection only).
- **Python style:** `from __future__ import annotations`, frozen dataclasses for value types, function-local imports inside CLI command bodies.
- **Pinned Lima version: `2.2.0`.** Archive URLs and digests, verbatim:
  - `arm64` — `https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/releases/download/v2.2.0/lima-2.2.0-Darwin-arm64.tar.gz`
    sha256 `bbdef91774885a0d05f7b048c4eb89ae2bcf3a0c252ae7ca7934e63df76d93c3`
  - `x86_64` — `https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/releases/download/v2.2.0/lima-2.2.0-Darwin-x86_64.tar.gz`
    sha256 `0d6f99c19f6e4bc3c92730c4c29d929e6927f0cb0a0ba1a84383367135a8ff31`
  These are the main release tarballs, which carry the **native-arch** guest agent. `lima-additional-guestagents-*` is for running a guest of a different architecture and is deliberately not fetched.
- **Tests never spawn `wsl.exe` or `limactl`, never touch a real VM, never reach the network, and never open a window.** Inject a fake runner, a fake `fetch`, or a `FakeProvider`.
- **Repo-file lookups in tests resolve from `__file__`,** never from the working directory, and assert they scanned something. A cwd-relative `Path("host")` has passed vacuously here three times.

**Run the suite with** `python3 -m pytest -q` (444 tests today, ~8s). If `tmp_path` fixtures error, prefix with `TMPDIR=<writable dir>` — a sandbox artifact, not a code bug.

---

### Task 1: Downloads report progress

`fetch()` already accepts `on_progress`; nothing passes one, so a 391 MB rootfs download sits behind an indeterminate bar on Windows today. The new Lima download needs the same channel, so build it once, first.

**Files:**
- Modify: `host/core/install.py` (the `Progress` and `Step` dataclasses, `run_install`, `default_steps`)
- Modify: `host/cli.py` (the `report` closure inside `setup`)
- Test: `tests/host/test_install_progress.py` (create)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces:
  - `Progress(step: str, status: str, message: str = "", fraction: float | None = None)`
  - `Step(name, run, always_run=False, action="", label="", progress=False)` — when `progress=True`, `run_install` calls `step.run(emit)` with `emit(done: int, total: int) -> None`; otherwise it calls `step.run()` as today.
  - `label` is the human-readable name for a step whose text comes from the provider; empty means "the UI decides".

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/host/test_install_progress.py
"""A download step must be able to say how far along it is.

fetch() has taken an on_progress callback since it was written and nothing
ever passed one, so the installer's only long step reported nothing at all.
"""
from host.core.install import InstallState, Progress, Step, run_install


def _events(steps, tmp_path):
    seen = []
    run_install(steps, InstallState(tmp_path / "state.json"), seen.append)
    return seen


def test_a_progress_step_is_handed_an_emitter(tmp_path):
    def run(emit):
        emit(50, 200)
        emit(200, 200)

    seen = _events([Step("fetch_image", run, progress=True)], tmp_path)
    fractions = [e.fraction for e in seen if e.fraction is not None]
    assert fractions == [0.25, 1.0]
    assert all(e.step == "fetch_image" and e.status == "running"
               for e in seen if e.fraction is not None)


def test_a_plain_step_is_still_called_with_no_arguments(tmp_path):
    # Every existing step takes no arguments, and every test that builds a toy
    # step does too. Adding progress must not change that contract.
    seen = _events([Step("finish", lambda: "done")], tmp_path)
    assert [(e.step, e.status) for e in seen] == [("finish", "running"), ("finish", "done")]


def test_a_zero_length_download_reports_no_fraction(tmp_path):
    # Content-Length can be absent, and 0/0 must not raise inside the installer.
    seen = _events([Step("fetch_image", lambda emit: emit(0, 0), progress=True)], tmp_path)
    assert [e for e in seen if e.fraction is not None] == []


def test_progress_defaults_to_no_fraction():
    assert Progress("verify", "running").fraction is None
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/host/test_install_progress.py -q`
Expected: FAIL — `Step.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'progress'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `host/core/install.py`, extend the two dataclasses:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Progress:
    step: str
    status: str          # running | done | skipped | failed | reboot
    message: str = ""
    # How far through a long step we are, 0.0-1.0, and only for a step that
    # declared `progress=True`. None on every other event, including the
    # `running` one that opens such a step.
    fraction: float | None = None
```

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Step:
    name: str
    run: Callable[..., str | None]
    always_run: bool = False
    action: str = ""
    # Set by a provider that names its own step -- "Installing Lima" is Lima's
    # word, not the installer's. Empty means the UI picks the text.
    label: str = ""
    # When true, `run` is called with an `emit(done, total)` callable instead
    # of with nothing. Only the two download steps set it; every other step,
    # and every toy step in the tests, keeps the no-argument signature.
    progress: bool = False
```

In `run_install`, replace the single `message = step.run()` call:

```python
        report(Progress(step.name, "running"))
        try:
            message = step.run(_emitter(step.name, report)) if step.progress else step.run()
```

and add the emitter beside it:

```python
def _emitter(name: str, report: Callable[[Progress], None]):
    """A fraction channel for one step, throttled to whole percents.

    `fetch` calls back once per megabyte, which is 391 events for the rootfs.
    The UI drains a queue on a timer and would cope, but a headless run would
    not, and neither would a log file.
    """
    last = [-1]

    def emit(done: int, total: int) -> None:
        if not total:
            return          # no Content-Length: nothing truthful to report
        percent = int(done * 100 / total)
        if percent == last[0]:
            return
        last[0] = percent
        report(Progress(name, "running", fraction=done / total))

    return emit
```

In `default_steps`, make `step()` carry the two new fields and mark `fetch_image`:

```python
    def step(name: str, run, *, always_run: bool = False, label: str = "",
             progress: bool = False) -> Step:
        return Step(name, run, always_run=always_run, action=_ACTIONS.get(name, ""),
                    label=label, progress=progress)
```

```python
    def fetch_image(emit):
        fetch(image, rootfs, on_progress=emit)
```

```python
        steps.append(step("fetch_image", fetch_image, always_run=True, progress=True))
```

In `host/cli.py`, the headless `report` closure must ignore fraction events — it prints one line per event, and 100 of them for a download is not a report:

```python
    def report(progress: Progress):
        if progress.fraction is not None:
            return          # the window draws a bar; a terminal would print 100 lines
        if progress.status not in ("running", "done", "failed"):
            return
        typer.echo(f"[{progress.status:>7}] {progress.step}")
        if progress.message:
            typer.echo(progress.message)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the new tests, then the whole suite**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/host/test_install_progress.py -q && python3 -m pytest -q`
Expected: the new file passes; the full suite stays green (444 passing today — the count grows, nothing regresses).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/host/test_install_progress.py host/core/install.py host/cli.py
git commit -m "feat(install): steps can report download progress as a fraction"
```

### Task 2: `lima_install` — fetch, verify and unpack a pinned Lima

The module that knows about the Lima release and nothing else. No provider, no step, no UI yet: this task ends with a tested function that puts a working `limactl` on disk.

**Files:**
- Create: `host/providers/lima_install.py`
- Test: `tests/host/test_lima_install.py` (create)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `host.core.images.Image(url, sha256)`, `host.core.download.fetch(image, dest, *, opener, on_progress)`.
- Produces:
  - `LIMA_VERSION: str` = `"2.2.0"`
  - `ARCHIVES: dict[str, Image]` keyed `"arm64"` / `"x86_64"`
  - `archive_for(machine: str) -> Image`
  - `managed_root(root: Path) -> Path` → `root / "lima"`
  - `managed_limactl(root: Path) -> Path` → `root / "lima" / "bin" / "limactl"`
  - `install(root: Path, *, fetch=fetch, runner=_default_runner, on_progress=None) -> Path`
  - `LimaInstallError(RuntimeError)`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/host/test_lima_install.py
"""Putting a pinned Lima on disk.

Downloading is the easy half. The half that matters is refusing to believe the
work happened: this repo has already shipped two provisioning steps that

Note for the implementer: `install()` moves the staging directory into place, so the `shutil.rmtree(staging)` in the `finally` is a no-op on success and a cleanup on failure. That is intended.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/host/test_lima_install.py -q && python3 -m pytest -q`
Expected: the new file passes; the suite stays green. In particular `tests/host/test_host_dependencies.py` must still pass — this module imports only stdlib plus `host.core`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add host/providers/lima_install.py tests/host/test_lima_install.py
git commit -m "feat(lima): fetch, verify and unpack a pinned Lima release"
```

### Task 3: Setup installs Lima — `runtime()` and the `install_runtime` step

Wire Task 2 into the install list, stop dead-ending on a missing Lima, and make the managed copy the one the provider uses.

**Files:**
- Modify: `host/core/provider.py` (add `Runtime`)
- Modify: `host/core/install.py` (`default_steps`, `_ACTIONS`)
- Modify: `host/providers/lima.py` (`default_data_root`, `find_limactl`, `__init__`, `is_supported`, `preflight`, `runtime`)
- Modify: `host/providers/wsl2.py` (`runtime` returning `None`)
- Modify: `host/providers/__init__.py` (`default_install_dir`, `get_provider`)
- Modify: `host/providers/omelet.yaml` (the x86_64 image)
- Test: `tests/host/test_default_steps.py`, `tests/host/test_lima.py`, `tests/host/test_factory.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `lima_install.install`, `lima_install.managed_limactl`, `Progress`/`Step` from Task 1.
- Produces:
  - `host.core.provider.Runtime(label: str, run: Callable[[Callable[[int, int], None] | None], None])`
  - `provider.runtime() -> Runtime | None` on both providers
  - `host.providers.lima.default_data_root() -> Path`
  - `LimaProvider(..., data_root: Path | None = None)`
  - `find_limactl(name="limactl", *, which=shutil.which, prefixes=BREW_PREFIXES, managed: Path | None = None)`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```python
# tests/host/test_default_steps.py  — append
def test_a_provider_with_a_runtime_gets_an_install_step_after_preflight(tmp_path):
    provider = SelfImagingProvider()
    calls = []
    provider.runtime_value = Runtime("Installing Lima", lambda emit: calls.append(emit))
    names = [s.name for s in build(provider, tmp_path)]
    assert names[:2] == ["preflight", "install_runtime"]
    assert "fetch_image" not in names


def test_the_install_step_carries_the_providers_own_label(tmp_path):
    provider = SelfImagingProvider()
    provider.runtime_value = Runtime("Installing Lima", lambda emit: None)
    step = next(s for s in build(provider, tmp_path) if s.name == "install_runtime")
    assert step.label == "Installing Lima"
    assert step.progress is True
    # Never recorded as done: what it produces is a directory a user can
    # delete, and re-deriving it costs one file read.
    assert step.always_run is True
    assert step.action, "a failed download needs a sentence telling the user what to do"


def test_a_provider_with_no_runtime_gets_no_install_step(tmp_path):
    assert "install_runtime" not in [s.name for s in build(FakeProvider(), tmp_path)]
```

Add to the top of that file: `from host.core.provider import Runtime`, and give the two fake providers the member:

```python
class FakeProvider:
    ...
    runtime_value = None

    def runtime(self):
        return self.runtime_value
```

```python
# tests/host/test_lima.py  — append
import host.providers.lima_install as lima_install
from host.core.provider import Runtime


def test_find_limactl_prefers_the_managed_copy_over_homebrew(tmp_path):
    managed = tmp_path / "lima" / "bin" / "limactl"
    managed.parent.mkdir(parents=True)

                         managed=managed)
    assert found == str(managed)


def test_find_limactl_falls_back_to_the_path_before_setup_has_run(tmp_path):
    # A source checkout that has never run setup has no managed copy; a
    # developer's brew install is what makes `omelet doctor` answerable there.
    missing = tmp_path / "lima" / "bin" / "limactl"
    found = find_limactl(which=lambda name: "/opt/homebrew/bin/limactl",
                         managed=missing)
    assert found == "/opt/homebrew/bin/limactl"


def test_preflight_no_longer_dead_ends_on_a_missing_lima():
    # Installing Lima is setup's job now. A preflight that stops for it is
    # setup refusing to do its own work.
    diagnosis = make(FakeRunner()).preflight()
    assert diagnosis.dead_ends == []


def test_doctor_still_reports_a_missing_lima_and_names_setup_as_the_fix():
    provider = LimaProvider(name="omelet-vm", limactl="/nowhere/limactl",
                            runner=FakeRunner(), data_root=Path("/nowhere"))
    diagnosis = provider.is_supported()
    lima_check = next(c for c in diagnosis.checks if "Lima" in c.label)
    assert not lima_check.ok
    assert "setup" in lima_check.fix.lower()
    assert "brew" not in lima_check.fix.lower()


def test_runtime_installs_into_the_providers_data_root(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    seen = {}

    def fake_install(root, *, on_progress=None):
        seen["root"] = root
        seen["on_progress"] = on_progress
        return root / "lima" / "bin" / "limactl"

    monkeypatch.setattr(lima_install, "install", fake_install)
    provider = LimaProvider(name="omelet-vm", runner=FakeRunner(), data_root=tmp_path)
    runtime = provider.runtime()
    assert isinstance(runtime, Runtime)
    assert "Lima" in runtime.label
    emit = lambda done, total: None
    runtime.run(emit)
    assert seen == {"root": tmp_path, "on_progress": emit}


def test_the_wsl2_provider_has_nothing_to_install():
    from host.providers.wsl2 import Wsl2Provider
    assert Wsl2Provider(arch="amd64").runtime() is None
```

```python
# tests/host/test_factory.py  — append
def test_the_lima_data_root_is_the_parent_of_the_install_dir(monkeypatch):
    # One literal, in lima.py. Two would drift, and the symptom would be a
    # limactl setup installed somewhere the provider never looks.
    from host.providers import default_install_dir
    from host.providers.lima import default_data_root
    monkeypatch.setattr(sys, "platform", "darwin")
    assert default_install_dir().parent == default_data_root()
```

```python
# tests/host/test_provider_surface.py — change one line
INSTALL_SURFACE = {"image", "register_resume", "location", "terminal",
                   "remediable", "runtime", "access"}
```

(`access` lands in Task 4; this line is written once, and Task 3 leaves `test_every_provider_answers_what_the_install_list_asks_of_it` failing until then. If you would rather keep the suite green between tasks, add `"runtime"` here now and `"access"` in Task 4.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them and watch them fail**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/host/test_default_steps.py tests/host/test_lima.py tests/host/test_factory.py -q`
Expected: FAIL — `AttributeError: 'LimaProvider' object has no attribute 'runtime'` and `TypeError: find_limactl() got an unexpected keyword argument 'managed'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `host/core/provider.py`, beside the other value types:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Runtime:
    """A program the VM platform needs that setup installs for the user.

    `None` from `provider.runtime()` means the platform ships it -- wsl.exe is
    part of Windows. A value means one step, named by `label`, calling `run`
    with the installer's fraction emitter.
    """
    label: str
    run: Callable[[Callable[[int, int], None] | None], None]
```

with `from typing import Callable, Protocol, runtime_checkable` at the top.

In `host/core/install.py`, add the action sentence:

```python
    "install_runtime": "Lima could not be downloaded — the internet connection "
                       "was unavailable, or the download did not match its "
                       "checksum. Run setup again; the download continues from "
                       "where it stopped.",
```

and insert the step in `default_steps`, immediately after `preflight`:

```python
    steps = [step("preflight", lambda: preflight_step(provider))]
    # What the VM platform itself needs, which on macOS is Lima. None on
    # Windows, where wsl.exe is part of the OS -- the same shape as image():
    # the step is absent rather than present and skipped.
    runtime = provider.runtime()
    if runtime is not None:
        steps.append(step("install_runtime", runtime.run, always_run=True,
                          label=runtime.label, progress=True))
```

In `host/providers/lima.py`:

```python
def default_data_root() -> Path:
    """Everything the host keeps for itself on this platform: the VM directory,
    the download cache and the managed Lima. The single literal -- the provider
    factory's default_install_dir() is derived from it, so the two cannot
    disagree about where setup put limactl."""
    return Path.home() / ".local" / "share" / "omelet"
```

```python
def find_limactl(name: str = "limactl", *, which=shutil.which,
                 prefixes=BREW_PREFIXES, managed: Path | None = None) -> str:
    """Absolute path to limactl, or `name` unchanged if it was not found.

    and every assumption LimaProvider makes about Lima's on-disk layout is an
    assumption about that version. A user's Homebrew Lima is never removed,
    never upgraded and never used once ours is there -- the fallback below
    exists for one case, a source checkout that has never run setup.
    """
    if os.sep in name:
        return name             # an explicit path: a test, or a bundled copy
    if managed is not None and os.access(managed, os.X_OK):
        return str(managed)
    found = which(name)
    if found:
        return found
    for prefix in prefixes:

        if os.access(candidate, os.X_OK):
            return candidate
    return name
```

Add `data_root` to `__init__` (after `lima_home`):

```python
                 lima_home: Path | None = None, data_root: Path | None = None):
        ...
        self.data_root = Path(data_root) if data_root else default_data_root()
```

Replace `is_supported` and `preflight`:

```python
    def is_supported(self) -> Diagnosis:
        """What `omelet doctor` prints: the whole truth about this machine.

        Wider than preflight() on purpose, and the reverse of the WSL2
        provider, where preflight is the richer of the two. Setup installs Lima
        itself now, so preflight must not stop for it -- but a user running
        doctor still deserves to be told it is missing, and told that setup is
        what fixes it.
        """
        checks = list(self._os_checks())
        from shutil import which
        present = os.access(self.limactl, os.X_OK) or which(self.limactl) is not None
        checks.append(CheckResult(
            f"Lima {lima_install.LIMA_VERSION}", present,
            None if present else "run Omelet setup, which installs Lima for you"))
        return Diagnosis(checks)

    def _os_checks(self):

        yield CheckResult(
            f"macOS 13 or newer (found {release or 'unknown'})", major >= 13,
            None if major >= 13 else
            "Omelet needs macOS 13 or newer; this Mac cannot run it")

    def preflight(self) -> Diagnosis:
        """What setup gates on before it installs anything. Only facts about
        this computer that no step can change."""

```

with `from . import lima_install` and `from ..core.provider import Completed, Diagnosis, CheckResult, Runtime` at the top. Import `lima_install` as a module, not its names — the test monkeypatches `lima_install.install`.

In `host/providers/wsl2.py`, beside `image()`:

```python
    def runtime(self):
        """Nothing to install: wsl.exe ships with Windows, and what it needs
        turned on is `remediable` above, not a download."""
        return None
```

In `host/providers/__init__.py`:

```python
from .lima import LimaProvider, default_data_root, find_limactl
from .lima_install import managed_limactl


def default_install_dir() -> Path:
    if sys.platform == "win32":
        base = os.environ.get("LOCALAPPDATA", str(Path.home()))
        return Path(base) / "Omelet" / "vm"
    return default_data_root() / "vm"

                            data_root=root)
```

In `host/providers/omelet.yaml`, add the second image beside the first:

```yaml
images:
  - location: "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/24.04/release/ubuntu-24.04-server-cloudimg-arm64.img"
    arch: "aarch64"
  # distribution.xml stamps the building machine's arch into hostArchitectures,
  # so an Intel build is a supported artifact and needs an image it can boot.
  - location: "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/24.04/release/ubuntu-24.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img"
    arch: "x86_64"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/host -q && python3 -m pytest -q`
Expected: everything passes except `test_every_provider_answers_what_the_install_list_asks_of_it`, which stays red until Task 4 adds `access()`. Note the failure and move on — or stage `INSTALL_SURFACE` in two halves as described above.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add host/core/provider.py host/core/install.py host/providers tests/host
git commit -m "feat(macos): setup installs Lima instead of telling the user to"
```

### Task 4: `access()` — the facts a coding agent needs

**Files:**
- Modify: `host/core/provider.py` (`Access`, `AccessField`)
- Modify: `host/providers/lima.py` (`access`)
- Modify: `host/providers/wsl2.py` (`access`)
- Modify: `tests/host/test_provider_surface.py`
- Test: `tests/host/test_access.py` (create)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `AccessField(label: str, value: str)`
  - `Access(headline: str, summary: str, command: str, fields: tuple[AccessField, ...] = (), note: str = "")`
  - `provider.access() -> Access` on both providers

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/host/test_access.py
"""What the status screen tells a user who wants their coding agent in the VM.

The screen renders an Access value and knows nothing about SSH. That is the
point: WSL has no SSH server, and a screen that assumed one would be a

### Task 7: The wizard screen

**Files:**
- Create: `host/setup_app/wizard.py`
- Test: `tests/host/test_setup_app_logic.py` (extend)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `theme`, `widgets`, `host.core.install.{Progress, Step, run_install, RebootRequired, DeadEnd, InstallError, RESUME_NOTICE}`.
- Produces:
  - `wizard.step_label(step) -> str`
  - `wizard.LABELS: dict[str, str]`
  - `wizard.Outcome(code: int, message: str, log: tuple[str, ...])`
  - `wizard.WizardScreen(parent, palette, fonts, steps, state, on_finished, *, resumed=False)` — a `tk.Frame` that starts its worker on `start()` and calls `on_finished(Outcome)` on the main thread.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

    assert "install_runtime" not in wizard.LABELS


def test_the_windows_only_steps_are_still_named_for_windows():

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/host/test_setup_app_logic.py -q`

### Task 9: The router, and the CLI that opens it

**Files:**
- Modify: `host/setup_app/app.py` (replace `run_window` entirely)
- Modify: `host/cli.py` (`setup` builds a steps factory)
- Modify: `packaging/macos/omelet.spec`, `packaging/windows/omelet.spec` (hidden imports)
- Test: `tests/test_setup_cli.py` (extend)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything from Tasks 5–8.
- Produces:
  - `app.run_window(provider, steps_factory, state, *, resumed: bool = False) -> int`
  - `steps_factory: Callable[[], list[Step]]`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/test_setup_cli.py — append
def test_setup_hands_the_window_a_factory_it_can_call_twice(monkeypatch, tmp_path):
    """Re-run setup must build a fresh step list.

    The steps close over provider state (`provider.rootfs` is assigned while
    the list is built), so handing the window one list and running it twice
    would re-run the second install against the first one's bindings.
    """
    import host.cli as cli

    captured = {}

    def fake_run_window(provider, steps_factory, state, *, resumed=False):
        captured["provider"] = provider
        steps_factory()
        steps_factory()
        captured["resumed"] = resumed
        return 0

    monkeypatch.setattr("host.setup_app.app.run_window", fake_run_window)
    monkeypatch.setattr(cli, "_provider_factory", lambda: FakeProvider())
    monkeypatch.setattr("host.providers.default_install_dir",
                        lambda: tmp_path / "vm")

    result = runner.invoke(app, ["setup"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert captured["resumed"] is False
```

(Use the `FakeProvider` and `runner`/`app` already defined in that file; give the fake the `runtime()` and `access()` members added in Tasks 3 and 4, returning `None` and a minimal `Access` respectively.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_setup_cli.py -q`
Expected: FAIL — `run_window()` takes the old three-argument signature.

# and the wizard that runs the install.
#
# It opens on status even when nothing is provisioned -- and starts the wizard
# itself in that case, so a first-time user still double-clicks once. On a
# machine that is already set up, the status screen is where the SSH details
# are, and nothing re-runs a multi-minute install just to show them.

```

In `host/cli.py`'s `setup`, build a factory instead of a list:

```python
    def build_steps():
        return default_steps(
            provider,
            cache_dir=root / "cache",
            template_dir=VERIFY_TEMPLATE,
            domain=constants.DEFAULT_DOMAIN,
            exe_path=_sys.executable,
        )

    if not headless:
        from host.setup_app.app import run_window
        raise typer.Exit(code=run_window(provider, build_steps, state, resumed=resume))

    steps = build_steps()
```

and use `steps` for the headless path below, unchanged.

In both `packaging/macos/omelet.spec` and `packaging/windows/omelet.spec`, extend the hidden imports — `setup_app` is reached only by a function-local import, so PyInstaller does not see the new modules:

```python
HIDDEN = ["host.setup_app.app", "host.setup_app.wizard", "host.setup_app.status",
          "host.setup_app.theme", "host.setup_app.widgets"]
```

and pass `hiddenimports=HIDDEN` to each `Analysis`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `python3 -m pytest -q`
Expected: green, all of it.

- [ ] **Step 5: Manual smoke, on the Mac**

```bash
python3 -m host.cli setup --headless   # expect it to stop at install_runtime or later
python3 -m host.cli doctor             # expect macOS + Lima checks, not a brew instruction
```

Then open the window (`python3 -c "from host.cli import app; app(['setup'])"`), confirm it lands on the status screen, and confirm the buttons work. Do **not** let the install run to `create_vm` unless you intend a real VM — see the verification report.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add host/setup_app/app.py host/cli.py packaging tests/test_setup_cli.py
git commit -m "feat(setup-app): open on a status screen, run setup from a button"
```

---

### Task 10: The build, the docs, and the honest verdict

**Files:**
- Modify: `packaging/macos/build.sh` (assert the new hidden imports made it in)
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md`
- Modify: `docs/macos-install-test-matrix.md`
- Modify: `docs/lima-verification-report.md`
- Modify: `host/cli.py` (`selfcheck`)

- [ ] **Step 1: Extend `selfcheck` so a missing screen fails the build, not the user**

`selfcheck` exists because `version` passes on a bundle missing an asset. The same hazard now applies to the five `setup_app` modules, which are reached only through a function-local import. Add to `host/cli.py`'s `selfcheck`:

```python
    # The setup window is five modules PyInstaller can only find through the
    # spec's hiddenimports. A bundle missing one launches, shows a Dock icon
    # and dies on the first draw -- which is exactly what this command exists
    # to catch before a user does.
    import importlib
    for name in ("theme", "widgets", "wizard", "status", "app"):
        importlib.import_module(f"host.setup_app.{name}")
    typer.echo("✓ setup window modules import")
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Build and verify**

```bash
bash packaging/macos/build.sh
```

Expected: exits 0; `omelet version`, `omelet selfcheck` both pass against the frozen binary; the two executable names and the two plist assertions still hold.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update `CLAUDE.md`**

Three edits, in the sections that are now wrong:

1. In the "install step list is built from the provider" bullet, change "five members" to seven and add:
   `runtime()` returning None means the VM platform ships with the host OS and `install_runtime` disappears; a value names the step and installs what the platform needs. `access()` is how the status screen shows a user the way into the VM without knowing what SSH is.
2. Replace the "A Mac app gets no shell PATH" bullet's conclusion — Lima is now installed by setup into `~/.local/share/omelet/lima`, and `find_limactl` prefers that copy over any Homebrew one. The PATH finding still holds for anything else the host shells out to by name.
3. Add to "Things that will bite you":
   **The setup window is two screens, and the app opens on the status one.** `host/setup_app/app.py` routes on `host/core/status.py::probe` — VM exists, guest reachable, `engine.version` present, agent API supported — and starts the wizard by itself only when nothing is provisioned. `theme.py` picks light or dark from the luminance of the ttk background rather than by asking which OS this is, which is what keeps the no-platform-branching invariant true in the UI layer. Fonts are tkinter's named system fonts; a hardcoded family name is how every label came to ask macOS for "Segoe UI".

- [ ] **Step 4: Update `docs/macos-install-test-matrix.md`**

- **Case 4 changes meaning.** It currently passes by printing `install Lima (brew install lima)`. Rewrite it: *Setup on a Mac without Lima* now proves setup **installs** Lima — pass condition is that `install_runtime` completes and `~/.local/share/omelet/lima/bin/limactl --version` prints 2.2.0. Mark the old result superseded; do not delete it.
- **New case 9:** *Setup with no network at `install_runtime`.* Pass condition: the step fails with the sentence from `_ACTIONS["install_runtime"]`, no stack trace, and a re-run with the network back resumes the partial download rather than restarting it.
- **New case 10:** *Open Omelet.app on a provisioned Mac.* Pass condition: the status screen appears within a few seconds without running an install; the SSH command and the four fields are populated from `~/.lima/omelet-vm/ssh.config`; Copy puts them on the clipboard; `ssh -F … lima-omelet-vm` from Terminal gets a shell.
- **New case 11:** *The window in dark mode and in light mode.* Pass condition: text is legible in both, with no white-on-white card and no black-on-black label, switched live via System Settings with the app reopened.
- **Update the Notes section:** the `--deep` signing hazard for a bundled `limactl` no longer applies, because Lima is fetched rather than bundled. Keep the paragraph and say why it is now moot — it is the reason the decision went the way it did.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update `docs/lima-verification-report.md`**

Add a section for this work saying exactly this much and no more:

- `install_runtime` is the first macOS path that can be verified without booting a VM: it ends by running the downloaded `limactl` and reading its version back. Record the result of that run.
- `~/.lima/<name>/ssh.config` now has two readers — `forward()` and `access()` — so the layout assumption is visible on the status screen instead of only inside a port forward.
- **Everything else is unchanged.** No VM has been created. `create_vm` is still the first unproven step, and `vz`, Rosetta, the port forwards and the ssh control master are all still assumptions. **The UNVERIFIED banners in `host/providers/lima.py` and `host/providers/omelet.yaml` stay.**
- `forwards()` still returns an empty list on Lima; that open question is not touched by this work.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run everything and commit**

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
git add CLAUDE.md docs packaging host/cli.py
git commit -m "docs: record what the macOS install work proves, and what it does not"
```

## Self-review

**Spec coverage.** Every section of the design maps to a task: Lima acquisition → Tasks 2 and 3; `runtime()` and the step → Task 3; `Progress.fraction` → Task 1; `find_limactl` order, the `preflight`/`is_supported` divergence and the x86_64 image → Task 3; `access()` → Task 4; the readiness probe → Task 5; the `setup_app` package → Tasks 6–9; Copy diagnostics → Task 8; docs and the honest verdict → Task 10.

**Known deviation from the spec:** the spec listed `tests/host/test_setup_app_logic.py` covering `palette_for`, elapsed time and `diagnostics_text`; this plan spreads those across Tasks 6, 7 and 8 in one file, which is the same coverage in three commits.

**Type consistency.** `Runtime.run` takes the emitter and returns None everywhere it appears (Tasks 1, 3). `Access`/`AccessField` field names are identical in Tasks 4, 8 and 9. `Readiness` field names match between Task 5's definition and Task 8's `summarize`/`diagnostics_text`. `run_window`'s signature matches between Task 9's `app.py` and `cli.py`. `install(root, *, fetch, runner, on_progress, machine)` in Task 2 matches the two-keyword call in Task 3.

**One thing left for the implementer, not a placeholder:** Task 3's note about staging `INSTALL_SURFACE` in one edit or two. Either is correct; one leaves a single test red between two commits.
