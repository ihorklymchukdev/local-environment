"""Entry point for the Omelet.app bundle.

The CLI and the setup window are one program with two front doors, exactly as
on Windows — where the installer's shortcut runs `setup.exe setup`, passing the
subcommand itself. Finder passes no arguments at all, so a bundle whose main
executable were the bare CLI would open, print its help to a console nobody is
watching, and exit. This adds the missing word.
